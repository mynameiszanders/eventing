Eventing PHP Framework
======================

Eventing is a PHP Framework based on [CodeIgniter] [4] by [Alexander Baldwin] [1],
licensed under either [MIT] [2] or [GPL v3] [3], whichever suits you best.

Like [CodeIgniter] [4], it uses Model-View-Controller, but adds other features
like multiple suffixes (file extensions) and a moderately advanced view
templating system.

The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is a fun project and is not
recommended for production use (late-alpha development).
It focuses on features that could be useful in [CodeIgniter] [4], but is not
designed to replace it. The main libraries that are included in [CodeIgniter] [4]
will not be included here.

Enjoy!
