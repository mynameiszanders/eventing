Eventing PHP Framework
======================

Eventing is a PHP framework based on the HMVC design pattern by
[Alexander Baldwin][1], licensed under the [MIT/X11][2].
At the core, the basic structure is similar to [CodeIgniter][3] (the early core
libraries were inspired by Codeigniter's design), but the framework boasts
features such as modules, namespaces, multiple URL suffixes, a moderately
advanced theme templating system, etc.

The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is a fun side-project and is not
recommended for production use.

Eventing requires PHP version 5.3 or greater.

Enjoy!
