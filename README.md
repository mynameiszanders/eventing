Eventing PHP Framework
======================

Eventing is a PHP Framework based on CodeIgniter by [Alexander Baldwin] [1],
licensed under either [MIT] [2] or [GPL v3] [3], whichever suits you best.

Like [CodeIgniter] [4], it uses Model-View-Controller, but adds other features
like multiple suffixes (file extensions) and a simple view templating system.

The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is a fun project and is not
recommended for production use (late-alpha development).
It focuses on features that could be useful in CodeIgniter, but is not designed
to replace it. The main libraries that are included in CodeIgniter will not be
included here.

Enjoy!
