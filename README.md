Eventing is a PHP Framework based on CodeIgniter.

Like CodeIgniter, it uses Model-View-Controller, but adds other features like
multiple suffixes (file extensions) and a simple view templating system.

The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is a fun project and is not
recommended for production use.
It focuses on features that could be useful in CodeIgniter, but is not designed
to replace it. The main libraries that are included in CodeIgniter will not be
included here.

Enjoy!
