Eventing PHP Framework ![Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/mynameiszanders/eventing.png "Project Status")
======================

Eventing is a PHP framework by [Zander Baldwin][1] based on the HMVC design pattern, licensed under the [MIT/X11][2].
At the core, the basic structure is similar to [CodeIgniter][3] (the early core libraries were inspired by Codeigniter's design), but the framework boasts features such as modules, namespaces, multiple URL suffixes, a moderately advanced theme templating system, etc.

The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is now the base for the [LessHub project][5] server-side framework. The repository has been transferred from [Zander's account][1] to [LessHub's][5] on GitHub and it is now being managed under the [Git Flow model][6].

Eventing requires [PHP version 5.3][4] or greater.

Enjoy!
