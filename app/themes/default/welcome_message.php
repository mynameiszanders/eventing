      <h1>Eventing</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Eventing PHP Application Framework.</p>

      <p>The page you are looking at is being generated dynamically. If you would like to edit this page, you'll find it located at:</p>
      <code>app/themes/default/welcome_message.php</code>
      
      <p>The corresponding controller for this page is located at:</p>
      <code>app/controllers/home.php</code>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, documentation is rather lacking at the moment. This will be rectified by the time we get round to releasing a public version (still under development).</p>
