<h2>Welcome to the Eventing Framework</h2>

<p>
  Eventing is a PHP Application Framework based loosely around <?php echo a('~ci', 'CodeIgniter'); ?>
  (see <?php echo a('general/credits', 'accreditations'); ?>) by <?php echo a('~profile', 'Alexander Baldwin'); ?>,
  licensed under either <?php echo a('~licensemit', 'MIT'); ?> or <?php echo a('~licensegpl', 'GPL v3'); ?> - whichever suits you best.
</p>

<p>
  Like CodeIgniter, it uses Model-View-Controller, but adds other features like
  multiple suffixes (file extensions) and a moderately advanced view templating system.
</p>

<p>
  The Eventing Framework, at this moment in time, is a fun project and is not
  recommended for production use (not yet reached initial public release). It
  focuses on features that could be useful in CodeIgniter, but is not designed
  to replace it. The main libraries that are included in CodeIgniter will not be
  included here. When they are eventually added in, they will be written from scratch,
  instead of copied.

<p>
  Enjoy!
